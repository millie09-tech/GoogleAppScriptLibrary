# GoogleAppScriptLibrary
Over the years, I have worked extensively with Google Apps Script. Although, a lot of it has been for business purposes, which unfortunately I cannot share. Although, here is bits and pieces of functions I've wrriten which I can share. 

iterateThroughRows FUNCTION: 
This function in essence, allowed me to go through more than a 1000 points of stock opening and closing dates for two companies, Neste Oil and Air Canada. It filtered the date of each stock and made sure they were the same, so I was able to generate graphical data for both.
